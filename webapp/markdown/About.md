# Camouflage - Helping the Colorblind Blend In

## About
Colorblindness is a genetic condition that affects at least 8% of males and 0.5% of females worldwide.
It affects a person's ability to see certain colors. For example, a person with protanomaly (red-
deficiency) might look at the color pink and only see grey. This leads colorblind people to have 
difficulty picking out clothes that appear to match to non-colorblind people. This app is designed
to help these people with selecting their outfits and ensuring that they match.


## How to Use Camouflage
Camouflage tells you if the colors in your clothes form a matching outfit.
First, take pictures of the clothing items in the outfit individually against a neutral background.
You can take pictures of any clothing item, including shirts, pants, shoes, skirts, hats, ties, scarves, etc.
Then, it will attempt to trim down the image to crop as close to the clothing item as possible.
If the image was cropped incorrectly, you can choose to use the original instead.
Then it will extract the five primary colors from each image.
Based on the most frequent color in each item, the app will classify the outfit as 'Basic', 'Neutral', 
'Analogus', 'Contrast', 'Summer', and/or 'Winter'.
If the outfit fits at least one classification then the outfit matches!
Use your own judgement when it comes to things like stripes with plaid, or wearing all the same color.
