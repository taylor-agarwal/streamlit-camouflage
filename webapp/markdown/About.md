## About
Colorblindness is a genetic condition that affects at least 8% of males and 0.5% of females worldwide.
It affects a person's ability to see certain colors. For example, a person with protanomaly (red-
deficiency) might look at the color pink and only see grey. This leads colorblind people to have 
difficulty picking out clothes that appear to match to non-colorblind people. This app is designed
to help these people with selecting their outfits and ensuring that they match!


## How to Use Camouflage
First, take pictures of the clothing items in the outfit individually under bright light and against a neutral background.
You can take pictures of any clothing item, including shirts, pants, shoes, skirts, hats, ties, scarves, etc.

You can then select the colors to compare from the ones extracted from the image.
You'll want to pick the ones that appear most dominantly in the clothing items you've captured.

Using the colors you selected, the app will classify the outfit as 'Basic', 'Neutral', 'Analogus', 'Contrast', 'Summer', and/or 'Winter'.
If the outfit fits at least one classification then the outfit matches!
You'll want to use your own judgement when it comes to things like stripes with plaid, or wearing all the same color.
