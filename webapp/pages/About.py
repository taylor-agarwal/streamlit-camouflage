# Camouflage - Helping the Colorblind Blend In

Colorblindness is a genetic condition that affects at least 8% of males and 0.5% of females worldwide.
It affects a person's ability to see certain colors. For example, a person with protanomaly (red-
deficiency) might look at the color pink and only see grey. This leads colorblind people to have 
difficulty picking out clothes that appear to match to non-colorblind people. This app is designed
to help these people with selecting their outfits and ensuring that they match.
